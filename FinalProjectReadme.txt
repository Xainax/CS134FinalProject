Hello! Before I talk about the game, I just wanted to say thank you both to the TA and the professor for a fun semester. 
Although the course was challenging, it was one I learned a lot from and had lots of fun taking. Hope you have a good summer!

Controls:

W/S: thrust up/down
Arrow keys (up, left, right, down): move foward, left, right, and backwards
Q/E: rotate lander left and right
To switch to different cameras press:
1 - EasyCam (can change view and move around)
2 - Cam tracking lander
3 - Onboard camera
4 - top view camera
R - to reset camera 

Game will start on launch. Afterwards, if you want to start or restart the game, press the spacebar

Issues that might come up during the game:
I wasn't able to figure out why, but sometimes the angular force gets messed up and rotating doesn't work. This does not happen all the time 
and sometimes relaunching the game just fixes it. If you manage to find out why, please let me know (for my sanity).
