# Moon Landing Simulation

This is a moon landing simulation game that I created for my CS134 Final Project. Along with this game, there is a trailer that helps
explains the features of the moon landing simulation game. Depending on time availability, I will go back and fix bugs and implement new
features. 

Controls:

W/S: thrust up/down
Arrow keys (up, left, right, down): move foward, left, right, and backwards
Q/E: rotate lander left and right
To switch to different cameras press:
1 - EasyCam (can change view and move around)
2 - Cam tracking lander
3 - Onboard camera
4 - top view camera
R - to reset camera 

Game will start on launch. Afterwards, if you want to start or restart the game, press the spacebar

Issues that might come up during the game:
I wasn't able to figure out why, but sometimes the angular force gets messed up and rotating doesn't work. This does not happen all the time 
and sometimes relaunching the game just fixes it.
